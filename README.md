# The Hoick Habit App
A habit building app based on the ["Don't break the chain"](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret) philosophy.

* Display a link icon for every day that a habit action is performed. Like Jerry Seinfeld you won't want to break the chain.
* Send habit data to your own [server](https://github.com/asommer70/thehoick-habit-server). Know that the data is backed up to a place that isn't going to mine it for their own profit.
* Set reminders for habit actions using native apps and integration. Google Calendar on Android and the Reminders app on iOS.
